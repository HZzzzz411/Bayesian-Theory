#1.3: Prior Distributions

### Conjugate Priors
- A prior distribution is said to be conjugate to a likelihood function if the posterior distribution is of the same family as the prior.
- This leads to the definition of a family of distributions, \( F \), being conjugate to a family of sampling distributions, \( P \), if the posterior distribution belongs to \( F \) for any sample size and any value of observations.
- Example: The Beta distribution is a conjugate prior to the Binomial distribution.

### Non-Informative/Vague Priors
- What should we do if we do not have any prior information concerning the parameter of interest?
- Bayes himself suggested that when this is the case, the Uniform prior should be used.
- The posterior distribution is proportional to the likelihood function when using a Uniform prior.
- Non-linear transformations of the parameter can result in a non-Uniform prior on the transformed parameter.
- Jeffreys' prior is based on an invariance rule for one-to-one transformations.

### Jeffreys' Prior
- Suggested by Jeffreys, this prior is based on the Fisher's Information.
- Fisher's Information, \( I(\theta|x) \), is defined as:
  \[ I(\theta|x) = E\left[ \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f(x|\theta) \right)^2 \right] \]
- Fisher's information can also be expressed as:
  \[ I(\theta|x) = -E\left[ \frac{\partial^2 \log f(x|\theta)}{\partial \theta^2} \right] \]
- Jeffreys' prior is given by:
  \[ p(\theta) \propto \sqrt{I(\theta|x)} \]
- This can be extended to the case where there are several unknown parameters.

### Informative Priors
- In many experiments or problems, experts will have an understanding of the system and hence some ideas as to what value the parameter(s) should take.
- This information needs to be independent of the observed data.
- It is useful for experts to specify their prior beliefs before conducting the given experiment.
- A Bayesian analysis of the subsequent data permits the formal inclusion of these prior beliefs within the analysis of the data within a robust framework via the specification of informative priors.
- However, in general an expert will not specify their prior beliefs in the form of a statistical distribution.
- To form a prior distribution that reflects an expert's prior knowledge a process of elicitation is used.
- Elicitation is the process of extracting prior knowledge in a suitable manner to permit the formulation of a suitable prior distribution that represents this information as accurately as possible.
- In general, the goal of this process is to identify and quantify the key aspects of prior knowledge, since the expert will find these easier to specify.
- Once summaries have been elicited, there will be more than one distributions that fit those summaries.
- In practice, once we elicit some key aspects of prior knowledge, we fit them to a distribution.
- We typically discuss the distribution with the expert, for example, showing a plot of the distribution and discussing several aspects or consequences of the given prior.
- If the expert is happy with the feedback, we consider it to be the prior; else discuss why the distribution does not represent the expert's beliefs and adjust the prior distribution accordingly and repeat.
